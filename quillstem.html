		<h2>What's in a name?</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Derailers get a lot of love within the bicycle community. They're cool, and their history has shown a lot of progress with designs and capabilities. There are entire collections and archives dedicated to derailers alone. But quietly through all the time was the humble quill stem. It has held bars with no frills and no questions for decades. Its design is unchanged, from early models.</p>
		<br>
		<p>They're disappearing, though. Almost all new bicycles worth their price come with dorky threadless stems. The reason is speculated, but bike manufacturers probably enjoy passing off the fork cutting labor off to bike shops (whereas with threaded headsets and forks, they would have to be cut down at the factory). They're also pretty cheap, requiring less metal. And racers use them. They sure aren't too cozy.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The odds are against the quill stem, but I choose to honor them. Some companies keep them going, especially boutique frame builders and retro-modern brands like Rivendell. Below are links to some of my favorites, both beautiful and wacky. Check them out and give your quill some appreciation... and grease. They're wonderful components and don't get enough love.
