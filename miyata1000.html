	<h2>1982 Miyata One-Thousand</h2>
	<img style="max-width: 65%; max-height: auto;" src="img/miyata1.jpeg" class="center">
	<br>
<p>I finally realized my bikes were much to small for me after a trip to Rivendell. I took to Craigslist and looked around for 57cm frames, which is what I found to be most comfortable, and found a Miyata One-Thousand. I knew it would need a lot of work and so did the previous owner - it was originally to be his project bike but he didn't have the time so sold it at a deep discount in account for it's unusable state. All bearing assemblies were dry and crunchy and the brakes were at least 15 years old. He said he didn't use it ever, so I can only assume the WD-40 all over the drivetrain was from the previous owner... all of the components were absolutely filthy and cleaning this bike took me a fair few hours.</p>

<p>My first order of business was stripping it down to the bare frame and rebuilding it. I took apart everything besides the wheels, which I don't have any plans for. I replaced them with a spare set of 700s I had lying around. I Repacked the bottom bracket and headset, cleaned off the crankset, and overhauled both derailers.</p>
<p>Cleaning isn't something that's talked about often. We know that to overhaul bearings you must remove old, dried out grease and apply new grease. But how do you clean things out properly? It's something I'm learning more and more through experience. Try not to remove old bearings with a magnet. I see it often and it's been my go-to method as it is very quick, but I've been noticing more and more that it magnetizes the ball bearings. And not just a little either. The ball bearings from this bike were a pain to overhaul as they all stuck to each other in my soapy water solution. I hear, too, that this may attract more dust via magnetism. I will try and find some tweezers suitable for this task and report back.</p>
<p>The groupset is pretty cool on this bike; Suntour Cyclone MII. It came stock with a 5x3 groupset, featuring the Suntour Apex crankset running a triple 38 x 48 x 52 tooth count. Quite a silly shift from second to third! The rear derailer also has cool cable routing. The cable routes through the inside of the parallelogram only visible when entering and exiting. It looks pretty on the bike, but it unfortunately didn't work with my 7 speed freewheel. It certainly won't work with my future plans. I would love to see more derailers with this couble routing, though maybe it's responsible for its lack of range.</p>

<p>I didn't realize this until after I bought the bike, but the Miyata one-thousand is really loved. It makes sense too. It fits 32 tires with fenders, has cantilever brakes, lugs, and all the mounts for racks. While I'm not sure I'd want to take it on super bumpy trails, I'm sure that's a statement of my preference and not one of the bike's ability. When I took it to China Camp with nothing but a front rack, it handled perfectly, only beginning to wobble a bit on the fast and windy downhill portions of the Richmond bridge.</p>
<p>Which brings me to it's current build. Full parts list is available at the bottom of the page. Original to the bike are the frame and fork (obviously), the headset, bottom bracket, crankset and chainrings, front derailer, shift levers, brake calipers, and least notably the seat post. I switched out the wheels as stated earlier and will build up a new set very soon. I plan to run 9 speed in the rear, which I already found a derailer for. I will likely replace the crankset at some point, too, but it works for now. I also replaced the bars and installed a stem to fit their clamp diameter. New brake levers we required and I opted for thumby shifters using the original levers.</p>
<p>As far as accessories go, I opted for the "More-the-merrier" approach. Fenders, front and rear racks, a basket, kickstand, bottle cages, a bell, a froggie keychain and fork stabilizer.</p>
<p>This bike is short-tour ready but longer tours would require some quality-of-life improvements. I'm looking to get new wheels, panniers and a few bags I'll sew up on a whim. Also something to make the brakes stronger. They're cantilever, but they're oddly spaced and not compatible with MTB cantilever sets. I'll search around...</p>
